## üöÄ Features

### 1. Analyze Text
- Detects phishing in emails, SMS, or other text messages.
- Scores content based on:
  - ML model confidence.
  - Suspicious URLs and attachments.
  - Presence of alphanumeric patterns commonly used in phishing.
- Provides a combined risk score and decision (SAFE or PHISHING).

### 2. Recent Analysis
- Maintains a history of recent analyses.
- Displays decisions in a table.
- Visualizes **decision distribution** with a pie chart.

### 3. Security Assistant (GPT)
- Ask predefined or custom security questions.
- Provides guidance using:
  - Built-in curated responses.
  - OpenAI GPT (optional, requires API key).

### 4. Machine Learning Model
- Uses **TF-IDF Vectorizer** + **Logistic Regression**.
- Handles small datasets and class imbalance.
- Custom preprocessing of text and URLs.

### 5. Heuristic Scoring
- Suspicious TLDs (`.xyz`, `.top`, `.club`) and dangerous file extensions (`.exe`, `.bat`, etc.) are scored.
- Combination of ML prediction and heuristic rules provides robust detection.

### 6. Custom UI
- Streamlit app with **neon cyber-style theme**.
- Animated icons and tabs for better UX.
